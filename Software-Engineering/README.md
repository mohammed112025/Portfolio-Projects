Welcome to the software egineering directory. Here you can see some of my projects in software engineering.

## Projects Overview

- <strong> Simple Shell </strong>: This project is a simple shell implementation built using C system calls. The goal of this project was to create a basic shell that allows users to execute commands and interact with the underlying operating system. The shell provides a command prompt where users can enter commands, and it executes those commands by creating child processes and using system calls to run the desired programs.

- <strong> Smart Home </strong>: The Arduino Smart Home Security System is a project that implements a comprehensive security system for a smart home using ESP32 and various sensors. The system includes features such as keypad authentication, gas and fire detection, motion detection, and remote monitoring through a web application with Firebase.
