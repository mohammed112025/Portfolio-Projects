<h1 align=center> Portfolio Project Repository </h1>

Welcome to the Portfolio Projects Repository! This repository contains the source code and related files for my projects in different fields related to:
- Data Science
- Machine learning
- Software Engineering


## Why Those fields
When I was in high school, I had a great passion in the field of data science and machine learning, because I am fascinated by the ability of those sciences to make fateful decisions or evaluate them with processes that help facilitate people's lives

So I studied a Bachelor's degree in Computing and Data Science at the Faculty of Computers and Data Sciences at Alexandria University.

Besides college, I developed my skills in data science and machine learning by studying some certificates and applying them through the work of projects and participating in Kaggle competitions.

In addition, I studied software engineering at Holberton School to acquire the appropriate skills for the model production stage in machine learning.

These were the reasons that made me develop my skills in those fields.
