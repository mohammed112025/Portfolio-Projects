## About me
When I was in high school, I had a great passion in the field of data science and machine learning, because I am fascinated by the ability of those sciences to make fateful decisions or evaluate them with processes that help facilitate people's lives

So I decided to study a Bachelor's degree in Computing and Data Science at the Faculty of Computers and Data Science at Alexandria University.

Besides college, I developed my skills in data science and machine learning by studying some certificates and applying them through the work of projects and participating in Kaggle competitions.

In addition, I studied software engineering at Holberton School to acquire the appropriate skills for the model deployment stage in machine learning.
