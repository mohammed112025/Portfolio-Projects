## Introduction
In this project, I am trying to apply my skills in data science by enabling New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) riders
to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride and generate valuable insights from their unused data.<br><br>



<a id="project_scenario"></a>
## Project Scenario
I am a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm. Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

In this scenario, I will consult with The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission to develop an app that will help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride.

#### My responsibilities as a data analytics consultant will be:
- Structure the necessary tasks into a project proposal that establishes milestones for the ride fare data project.
- Analyze, identify key variables, and prepare New York City TLC data for exploratory data analysis.

### Teams and Characters at Automatidata and the New York City TLC
#### Automatidata Team Members:
- Udo Bankole, Director of Data Analysis

- Deshawn Washington, Data Analysis Manager

- Luana Rodriquez, Senior Data Analyst

- Uli King, Senior Project Manager

#### New York City TLC Team Members:
- Juliana Soto, Finance and Administration Department Head

- Titus Nelson, Operations Manager

## Project Stages
1. Project Proposal
2. Understand The Data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Statistical Tests
5. Regression Modeling
6. Machine Learning Models
7. Share Final Findings



## 1- Project Proposal ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/Automatidata/project_proposal))
In the first stage of the project I extracted the project tasks from Automatidata leadership team meeting and used Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute (PACE) strategy
for deviding the tasks into a project proposal.

### About PACE Strategy
- The planning stage is where we conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project.
- The analyzing stage is where we will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.
- The construction stage is where we will build models that will allow us access to hidden relationships locked within data.
- The execution stage is where we will present the findings of our analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.

### The extracted tasks are:
-	Establish structure for project workflow 
-	Write a project proposal
-	Compile summary information about the data
-	Begin exploring the data
-	Data exploration and cleaning
-	Visualization building
-	Compute descriptive statistics
-	Conduct hypothesis testing
-	Build a regression model
-	Evaluate the model
-	Communicate final insights with stakeholders



## 2- Understand The Data
In the second stage of the project I will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. This project uses a dataset called 2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv. It contains data gathered by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. For each trip, there are many different data variables gathered.

### Approach
1. Review the data dictionary
2. Identify the variables
3. Examine the data structure
4. Understand the context
5. Assess quality of the data using standard data quality dimensions
     - Accuracy (completeted from data engineers of New York City TLC)
     - Completeness
     - Consistency
     - Currency
     - Relavency
     - Validity
     - Uniqueness
6. Share an executive summary with my team
