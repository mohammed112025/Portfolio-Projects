## Introduction
In this project, I am trying to apply my skills in data science by enabling New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) riders
to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride and generate valuable insights from their unused data.

## Project Scenario
I am a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm. Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

In this scenario, I will consult with The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission to develop an app that will help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride.

My responsibilities as a data analytics consultant will be:
- Structure the necessary tasks into a project proposal that establishes milestones for the ride fare data project.
- Analyze, identify key variables, and prepare New York City TLC data for exploratory data analysis.
