# Summary of the project
I applyed various Data Analytics skills and techniques that I have learned as part of the previous courses in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. In this project I assumed that I am an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organization and be presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets.  

I performed the various tasks that professional data analysts do as part of their jobs, including: 
- Data collection from multiple sources 
- Data wrangling and data preparation 
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Statistical analysis and data mining 
- Data visualization with different charts and plots, and 
- Interactive dashboard creation. 

The project culminated with a presentation of my data analysis report for various stakeholders in the organization. The report included an executive summary, my analysis, and a conclusion. 

As part of this project I demonstrated my proficiency with using Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, Relational Databases (RDBMS), Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Power BI, and Python Libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and others.
