## Introduction
In this project, I am trying to apply my skills in data science and machine learning by developing a machine learning model to predict user churn.
Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app.

## Project Scenario
I am the newest member of Waze’s data team. My team is about to begin their user churn project. This project focuses on monthly user churn.
An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

My responsibilities are:
- Create a project proposal.
