## Introduction
In this project, I am trying to apply my skills in data science and machine learning by developing a machine learning model to predict user churn and generate valuable insights from unused data. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app.

## Project Scenario
I am the newest member of Waze’s data team. My team is about to begin their user churn project. This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

- Who are the users most likely to churn?

- Why do users churn? 

- When do users churn? 

For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may simply lose these users without knowing why. 

My insights will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.

My responsibilities are:
- Create a project proposal.
- Inspect, organize, and prepare the data for analysis.
