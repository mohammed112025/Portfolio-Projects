# Introduction
In this project, I am trying to apply my skills in data science and machine learning by developing a machine learning model to predict user churn and generate valuable insights from unused data. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app.

<a id="project_scenario"></a>
# Project Scenario
I am the newest member of Waze’s data team. My team is about to begin their user churn project. This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

- Who are the users most likely to churn?

- Why do users churn? 

- When do users churn? 

For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may simply lose these users without knowing why. 

My insights will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.

### My responsibilities are:
- Create a project proposal.
- Inspect, organize, and prepare the data for analysis. 

### Data team roles:
- Harriet Hadzic - Director of Data Analysis 
- May Santner - Data Analysis Manager 
- Chidi Ga - Senior Data Analyst 
- Sylvester Esperanza - Senior Project Manager
  
### Cross-functional team members:
- Emrick Larson - Finance and Administration Department Head 
- Ursula Sayo - Operations Manager

# Project Stages
<a id="project_proposal"></a>
## Project Proposal ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/Waze/project_proposal))
In the first stage of the project I extracted the project tasks from Automatidata leadership team meeting and used Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute (PACE) strategy
for deviding the tasks into a project proposal.

### About PACE Strategy
- The planning stage is where we conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project.
- The analyzing stage is where we will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.
- The construction stage is where we will build models that will allow us access to hidden relationships locked within data.
- The execution stage is where we will present the findings of our analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.

## Understand The Data ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/Waze/understand_the_data))
In the second stage of the project I will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis.
This project uses a dataset called waze_dataset.csv. It contains synthetic data created for this project in partnership with Waze. Examine each data variable gathered. 

### Approach
1. Review the data dictionary
2. Download the data and build a dataframe
3. Identify the variables
4. Assess quality of the data using standard data quality dimensions
     - Uniqueness: Recorded that are Duplicated 
     - Consistency: Values Free from Contradiction
     - Relavency: Data Items with Value Meta-data
     - Validity: Data Containing Allowable Values
     - Completeness: Null values
5. Select the most important variables for training our model (requested from my team)
6. Share an executive summary with my team
